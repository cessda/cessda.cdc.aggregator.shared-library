### Changed

- The studies generator in `mappings.DynamicAggregatorBase` now assings
  the `study._aggregator_identifier`. The identifier is generated by
  first joining the source OAI-PMH Base URL and OAI Identifier by a
  separator '-', and then generating a sha256 hexadecimal notation of
  the result. (Implements [#27](https://bitbucket.org/cessda/cessda.cdc.aggregator.shared-library/issues/27))
- `Study._aggregator_identifier` can now be set using
  `records.Study.set_aggregator_identifier()`.
- `Study._aggregator_identifier` is no longer generated when creating a new
  Study-object.
- Update dependency of Kuha Common in requirements.txt. Use released
  version 1.0.0.
